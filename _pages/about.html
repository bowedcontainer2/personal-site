Hello There! My name is Matthew Pineda. I am a student studying Computer Science at Mount San Antonio College just east of Los Angeles, CA.
My skills in software development mainly lie in Front End web development, namely Javascript + React.JS, Django + Python, Ruby, and more.
I am currently interning at a healthcare startup in San Francisco, CA called <a href="https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/">Clover Health</a> working on the Front End in Django. I am also
a Code2040 Fellow, part of a program bringing together top Black and Latinx Computer Science Students through various events and mixers
in Silicon Valley. My career interests lie in healthtech, creative platforms, and mission driven organizations.
